The dataset was originally collected by CrowdFlower through the Twitter API. Tweets were sampled using relevant airline-related keywords and @mentions.

Human annotators were then employed to label each tweet with its sentiment: positive, neutral or negative.

In cases of negative sentiment, annotators also selected the reason (e.g., flight delay, bad customer service).

The dataset contains approximately 14,600 tweets, collected from real users, along with metadata like timestamp, airline name, and geographic info.
